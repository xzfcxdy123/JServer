# What is JServer?

JServer is a toolkit that automatically generates APIs based on JSON or Database.
You don't need to write server-side code to quickly implement additions, deletions, changes, queries, and pagination.

# Getting Started

## Installation

  ### Prerequisites

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18 or higher.
  - Terminal for accessing JServer via its command line interface (CLI).

  JServer can be used on its own, or be installed into an existing project. In both cases, you can install it with:

  ```sh
  npm install -g jserver
  ```

  Now you can check if the installation was successful through commands:

  ```sh
  jserver --version
  ```

  If there is a problem with executing the strategy, the following command can be used to solve it:

  ```sh
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

  If all of the above are correct, then we are done and ready to use.
